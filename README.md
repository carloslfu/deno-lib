# deno_lib

Fully-featured and extensible Deno crate for embedding Deno in your Rust app (unofficial). The current version is on par with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) v2.0.6 which is where most of the files come from. This project adds a few changes and adaptations to make Deno easy to work with as a library.
